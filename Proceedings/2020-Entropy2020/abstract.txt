Variability and granularity: two underpinnings for entropy


The Shannon entropy can be more precisely characterized as the variability of the elements within a statistical distribution: how different they are from each other. The Shannon entropy, in fact, is the only indicator of variability that is statistically linear. On the other hand, in a dynamical system, non-reversible evolution means different initial states merge into the same final state. Therefore the description of the overall evolution (i.e. the "world line" in state space) given by a state at a particular time becomes coarser and coarser (i.e. less accurate) over time: we have a natural indicator that increases under irreversible evolution. The thermodynamic entropy can be understood in terms of this "dynamical entropy" applied to a thermodynamic system. Note that the variability and the coarsening of the description in time are independent concepts as they are defined in unrelated situations, but they can be combined when studying the non-reversible evolution of statistical distributions. In this setting we recover the Gibbs (or von Neumann) entropy of statistical mechanics and maximization of Shannon entropy under irreversible evolution subject to constraints. This treatment allows us to clarify foundational aspects of the concept of entropy, providing both a crisper understanding and a perfect correspondence to the mathematical concepts.
