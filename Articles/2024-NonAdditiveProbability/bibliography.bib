Furthermore, we establish that the accessible fidelity for symmetric informationally complete signal ensembles is equal to the quantumness. Though spelling the most trouble for an eavesdropper because of this, it turns out that the accessible fidelity is nevertheless easy for her to achieve in this case: Any measurement consisting of rank-one POVM elements is an optimal measurement, and the simple procedure of reproducing the projector associated with the measurement outcome is an optimal output strategy.},

It has been shown (Adhikary et al. Eur Phys J D 74(68):68, 2020; Asthana et al. Quantum Inform Process 20(1):1--33, 2021) that the nonexistence of a classical joint probability scheme gives rise to sufficiency conditions for nonlocality, a nonclassical feature not restricted to quantum mechanics. The conditions for nonclassical features of quantum mechanics are obtained by employing pseudo-probabilities, which are expectation values of the parent pseudo-projections. The crux of the paper is that the pseudo-probabilities, which can take negative values, can be directly measured as anomalous weak values. We expect that this opens up new avenues for testing nonclassicality via weak measurements and also gives deeper insight into negative pseudo-probabilities, which become measurable. A quantum game, based on violation of a classical probability rule, is also proposed that can be played by employing weak measurements.",

	ABSTRACT = {Entropic Dynamics (ED) is a framework in which Quantum Mechanics is derived as an application of entropic methods of inference. In ED the dynamics of the probability distribution is driven by entropy subject to constraints that are codified into a quantity later identified as the phase of the wave function. The central challenge is to specify how those constraints are themselves updated. In this paper we review and extend the ED framework in several directions. A new version of ED is introduced in which particles follow smooth differentiable Brownian trajectories (as opposed to non-differentiable Brownian paths). To construct ED we make use of the fact that the space of probabilities and phases has a natural symplectic structure (i.e., it is a phase space with Hamiltonian flows and Poisson brackets). Then, using an argument based on information geometry, a metric structure is introduced. It is shown that the ED that preserves the symplectic and metric structures—which is a Hamilton-Killing flow in phase space—is the linear Schrödinger equation. These developments allow us to discuss why wave functions are complex and the connections between the superposition principle, the single-valuedness of wave functions, and the quantization of electric charges. Finally, it is observed that Hilbert spaces are not necessary ingredients in this construction. They are a clever but merely optional trick that turns out to be convenient for practical calculations.},

	abstract="A description of ensembles on configuration space incorporates at least two geometrical structures which arise in a natural way: a metric structure, which derives from the natural geometry associated with a space of probabilities, and a symplectic structure, which derives from the symplectic geometry associated with a Hamiltonian description of motion. We show that these two geometrical structures give rise to a K{\"a}hler geometry. We first consider probabilities P and introduce the information metric. This leads to information geometry, a Riemannian geometry defined on the space of probabilities. We then bring in dynamics via a Hamiltonian formalism defined on a phase space with canonically conjugate coordinates P and S. This leads to more geometrical structure, a symplectic geometry defined on this phase space. The next step is to extend the information metric, which is defined over the space of probabilities only, to a metric over the full phase space. This requires satisfying certain conditions which ensure the compatibility of the metric and symplectic structures. These conditions are equivalent to requiring that the space have a K{\"a}hler structure. In this way, we are led to a K{\"a}hler geometry. This rich geometrical structure allows for a reconstruction of the geometric formulation of quantum theory. One may associate a Hilbert space with the K{\"a}hler space and this leads to the standard version of quantum theory. Thus the theory of ensembles on configuration space permits a geometric derivation of quantum theory.",
