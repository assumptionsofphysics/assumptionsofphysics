Furthermore, we establish that the accessible fidelity for symmetric informationally complete signal ensembles is equal to the quantumness. Though spelling the most trouble for an eavesdropper because of this, it turns out that the accessible fidelity is nevertheless easy for her to achieve in this case: Any measurement consisting of rank-one POVM elements is an optimal measurement, and the simple procedure of reproducing the projector associated with the measurement outcome is an optimal output strategy.},

It has been shown (Adhikary et al. Eur Phys J D 74(68):68, 2020; Asthana et al. Quantum Inform Process 20(1):1--33, 2021) that the nonexistence of a classical joint probability scheme gives rise to sufficiency conditions for nonlocality, a nonclassical feature not restricted to quantum mechanics. The conditions for nonclassical features of quantum mechanics are obtained by employing pseudo-probabilities, which are expectation values of the parent pseudo-projections. The crux of the paper is that the pseudo-probabilities, which can take negative values, can be directly measured as anomalous weak values. We expect that this opens up new avenues for testing nonclassicality via weak measurements and also gives deeper insight into negative pseudo-probabilities, which become measurable. A quantum game, based on violation of a classical probability rule, is also proposed that can be played by employing weak measurements.",

This paper develops a formalism that exhibits explicitly, the manner in which rules of classical probability break down in the quantum domain. Thereby, a framework is set up which allows for construction of signatures for non-classicality of states in a systematic manner. Using this, conditions for non-locality and entanglement are shown to emerge from a break down of classical probability rules. Bell-CHSH non-locality is derived for any bipartite systems and entanglement inequalities are obtained for coupled two level systems only.",
