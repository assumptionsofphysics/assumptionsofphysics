Finding There are Many Different Conceptions of Classical Mechanics Appropriate and Useful for Different Purposes, I Argue That No Single Conception is Preferred. Instead of Arguing for or Against Determinism, I Stress the Wide Variety of Pragmatic Considerations That, in a Specific Context, May Lead One Usefully and Legitimately to Adopt One Conception Over Another in Which Determinism May or May Not Hold.},
