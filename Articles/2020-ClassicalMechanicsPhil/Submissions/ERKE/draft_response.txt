We thank both referees for their wonderfully helpful and constructive comments. We understand Referee 4 as not requesting modifications to the manuscript. We appreciate Referee 4's sympathy for our project and helpful suggestions for avoiding tedious burden-of-proof debates. Below, we mainly describe how we have modified the manuscript to address and incorporate Referee 2's concerns and suggestions.

Additionally, we thank the editors for their tireless efforts in obtaining such incredibly helpful referees! To facilitate ease of review, our changes to the manuscript are {\color{green}highlighted in green font} in the manuscript. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item[1a.)] To facilitate a more casual reading of the derivation, we have included brief summaries of the main results at the start of each subsection in section 4. If the referee or editors believe it is necessary, we would be willing to relegate some of the more tedious material to an appendix. Although we recognize that some parts are a bit dense, we prefer to keep it all together if we can. We also view the elementary nature of the proofs as a virtue (since it draws mainly just on calculus). 

\item[1b.)] Referee 2 suggested that we try to isolate all assumptions and conditions leading to each mathematical result, beyond the three main conditions we highlight. We attempted to do this, but the result was cumbersome and added significantly to length. Hence, we would prefer to maintain the current form, where each assumption is introduced as it becomes relevant. If Referee 2 or the editors believe that this kind of isolation is absolutely necessary, then we would be happy to pursue it. 

\item[1c.)] Referee 2 asks ``what is the operant sense of `leads to' " at play in our derivation. We believe it is the following: if a system satisfies the primary conditions at the start of each subsection, and if one chooses to model the system subject to the natural, physically motivated constraints that we introduce as the derivation proceeds, then one is forced to use the mathematical structures that we derive. As we note on page 10, many of these constraints are regulative in nature: they arise from physical conditions or well-motivated modeling assumptions, such as when we assume on page 12 that the distribution is independent of the choice of state variables. Although there may be a pure mathematical theorem hiding in the background, we prefer to make salient the relevant modeling assumptions, since we believe that these are crucial to understanding the physical significance of the mathematical frameworks we use in physics.

\item[2.)] In this vein, Referee 2 is completely correct that one is not strictly-speaking \textit{forced} to use a symplectic manifold to model systems that satisfy infinitesimal reducibility. On pages 5, 10, 11, and especially 12 (footnote 17) we have clarified that one is led to a symplectic manifold provided that \textit{they choose to model continuous quantities using the coordinates of a manifold} in the first place. We thank the referee for pressing us to clarify this important point.

\item[3a.)] Referee 2 worries that much of the work in our philosophical argument is done by the fact that we derive Lagrangian mechanics in only the hyper-regular regime, whereas our derivation of Hamiltonian mechanics is not restricted to hyper-regular systems. As the referee notes, our argument depends on the further claim that---unlike the Hamiltonian case---we cannot interpret non-hyper-regular Lagrangians as modeling classical systems. Following the referee's suggestion, we have flagged this important point throughout our discussion, on pages 2, 3, 5, 10, and 18. 

\item[3b.)] Nonetheless, we believe that our derivation still plays an essential role in our philosophical argument. Since the conditions we use to derive Hamiltonian mechanics are physically significant, this justifies our claim that Hamiltonian mechanics is interpretable outside the hyper-regular regime. Additionally, as we note on page 5, by deriving hyper-regularity from the motion equivalence condition, we thereby illuminate the physical meaning and significance of hyper-regularity. Our derivation is also crucial to providing a precise response to Curiel's criticism of Hamiltonian mechanics. 

\item[4.)] Referee 2 kindly suggested interpreting our derivation as filling an interpretative lacuna in the literature. We agree with this suggestion and have incorporated it on page 4.

\end{enumerate} 

Turning briefly to Referee 4's sympathetic and constructive comments, there is perhaps at least one point to clarify. Referee 4 suggests that it is misleading for us to claim that our argument for privileging Hamiltonian mechanics has advantages over North's treatment. We definitely agree that North or other metaphysically-inclined philosophers of physics would not view our avoidance of metaphysics as an advantage. Nonetheless, we do believe that our argument for privileging Hamiltonian mechanics is compatible with a more metaphysically-loaded interpretation. The metaphysically-inclined very well might find aspects of our argument conducive to their metaphysical aims. For instance, as Referee 4 notes, one might try to interpret greater mathematical generality as evidence of metaphysical joint-carving. Although we wanted to make clear that we are not engaged in this kind of metaphysical project, we are of course happy if our work helps those engaged in metaphysics. We especially appreciated Referee 4 noting that one of our primary aims is to provide ``philosophically illuminating interpretations of general formalisms" and that the paper strikes a happy balance ``between rigor and readability."
