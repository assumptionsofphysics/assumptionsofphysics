\begin{abstract}
In this work we show that the canonical transformations of classical Hamiltonian mechanics are exactly the transformations that preserve information.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Single degree of freedom}
Define distribution over phase space.

Show change under coordinate transformation.

Define information entropy.

Show change under coordinate transformation.

Show that conservation of information entropy is equivalent to transformation having Jacobian equals to 1.

Show that canonical transformations are the ones and only the ones that have the Jacobian equals to one. Show relation to Poisson bracket. Show relation to incompressible flow. Show relation to symplectic form.

Important point: the trick is setting up the problem, not the proof.

\section{Multiple degree of freedom}

Show conceptually what needs to happen. Need to be able to define marginal distributions on each degree of freedom. Jacobian preserved under all degrees of freedom. Symplectic form in multiple dimension preserves area and orthogonality. Product of marginals needs to be preserved.

Show that setting up the problem mathematically is more problematic because: symplectic geometry does not have the tools to talk about distributions as it focuses on objects that are coordinate independent, statistics does not care that distribution and information entropy is coordinate dependent since the prime object is the cumulative distribution function.

Spend the rest at making links between geometric objects and distributions.

Show the definitions for mutual information entropy.

\section{Discussion}

Why should we care? Because it provides links.

Uncertainty principle as relationship between entropy and uncertainty.

Relativistic Hamiltonian motion as preservation of entropy.

Relationship to conservation of energy in isolated systems.
