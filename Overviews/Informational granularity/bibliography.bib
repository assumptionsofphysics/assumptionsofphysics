	abstract={We compare the following three notions of uniformity for a finitely additive probability measure on the set of natural numbers: that it extend limiting relative frequency, that it be shift-invariant, and that it map every residue class mod{\^A} m to{\^A} 1/m. We find that these three types of uniformity can be naturally ordered. In particular, we prove that the set{\^A} L of extensions of limiting relative frequency is a proper subset of the set{\^A} S of shift-invariant measures and that{\^A} S is a proper subset of the set{\^A} R of measures which map residue classes uniformly. Moreover, we show that there are subsets{\^A} G of {\^a}„{\textbullet} for which the range of possible values {\^I}{\textonequarter}(G) for {\^I}{\textonequarter}{\^a}ˆˆL is properly contained in the set of values obtained when {\^I}{\textonequarter} ranges over{\^A} S, and that there are subsets{\^A} G which distinguish{\^A} S and{\^A} R analogously.},
